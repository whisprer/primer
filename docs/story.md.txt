i guess to do this right it should be properly told as the actual sttory then. so -to give quixlk summary:
- i got a bee on my bonnet one day that i was kinda bored of all the darned things i was in the middle of - like just didn't particularly fancy getting into a halfway progressed thing and grinding throigh errors etc. - i needed a dopamine hit a win.
- so i pondered what i could work on that would be a kinda self contained got a chance of finishing within a session sit down and get a finsih by and of day type thing
- i'll be damned if i have any exact record of quite what set me off, but from the oldest docs i do have, it se
ems i launched in pretty much straight at the deep end on a full blown 'i wanna do a SIMD taking advantage of thing - and since that suggest some kinda HEAVY math, someone [m?ChatGPT? Claude?A person on Discord? who knows...] came up with the idea of churning primes and so near automatically led to a default of 'to take a crack at the C++ RNG',
- here i do know also that i had in parallel found a repo that had an algo claiming to be an improvement upon the 'c++ std. mt12588` [i can never remember the no. sorro] lib - and so i dug up the associated journal paper and so had the basis for a solid grouding to build up the assualt upon the C++ std RNG.
<<<here i'll insert what think is the earliest doc i have so i'll pop a copyoasta of the beggining:>>>
```ok fren, slide sidetrack question -  right now i'm coding all this on a 2017 ms surface pro - i.e. it doesn't have SIMD-optimization capabilities as far as AVX etc. goes. is there anything i can take advantage of such as the gfx/cpu special combo setup or something?EditThat's a great question! Your 2017 Surface Pro actually does have some SIMD capabilities we can leverage, even if it doesn't support the latest AVX extensions.
Surface Pro 2017 models typically came with Intel Core i5-7300U or i7-7660U processors from the Kaby Lake generation. These processors support: ...```

<<<i note here also, at this particular time my current codsingg co9mputer was relastivelynew to me and frankly, it's a bit of a monster - 4.3GHzI7, 64GBDDR4RAM, NVIDIA P1000 Quadro GFX, alll in a;; tnhe thing eas jyust anall round fully stacked p poswrehouse - so natufally, wanted to take it for the kinda spin that would let me see quite how far this thing would go - like taking your new ferrari in a top speed run down the autbahn !>>> 

 - so for me it's qquite clear even at this pit so early i'm barely begun t dicument or really get properly intowhat iwant and yet i;m aslso clearly on the whole 'AVX;/SIMD/Acceleratjon/talking advntage of the computers full cspaabilities kida tack - i wantedto rn that thoing to it's full,run it hot - relaly se quite what i could get out of it whrn it was _properly_ pushed - ans so you cansee where this thing stemmmed form p much.

- and that's how the cpp primes project was born - not of interst in primes; not of interset in improving cpp libs; nope, i wanted to make my mew computer hot :D.

- now we jump ofrward to a couplaa days ago - i was once more loooking around for a nice instant dopamine project - but this time much more conciously aware of the existence of the 'beat a library and bring some improvments' concept - so when i was wathcing sa Rust project compile and spotted the word Random flash past, i made a note - yet, somehow, by a blind poece of luck, i stitlo sat watching anyways, and so also gthen nptoeced flashing by  - the word `primes` - and the llightbulb made me clean in the face, hard - frankly a little on the side of what can only be described as embarrassignly late given the cpp work was over 6 months previous.
- ypu, i admit 0 the cpp work i;d pretty much gone htough 'wow -loook hwo fast my new computer can crunch primes :O ooohhh - and then just gone ok, next then... somewhat loike a doctor gojng seamlessly from 'oyu;ve got cancer' to ';good morning mmr farnsworth, hows your cow'without droippig abeat or thinkbgn twice. it was pure n simole, welp, we finisihed that, so out of mind for the next thing - its done so we forget.
- but ofc now oit hit hime hard af - waitdint i haev a whole load of really efficiennt insanley fastand comically small cod speoicifcally for this tsask - and whats more its goddamn cpp so going over to rust is pretty much a bit of a fomality not much more! o.m.g. this is an  absolute gift -oh boy! oh boy! oh boy!
- as you can imagine there then followed an absolute insane frenzy of work as i tried, to as faat as possibly doable before i forgot any of this wonder [and jence my life would end in crushing horror of losing osmething magic... the ultimate fear!] - bt noi worries, i powed through the port torust of th cpp and the extra thepy of necessaries as fatr as furgher imorovements and optimizations, naturalllythen foilowed swiftly by the inevitable 'actual innovation' stgae where due working on an existing projrct, diuroing htose evil moments of comlile waitgn n thsliemy mindjsut cant stop and so i keep worki gon th eproject although ot is not actually able to progess - resulitin ginme unbunded and hence... prgress, innovation and novelty.
- part of me really hates this - that icant just be satidfued with getti  to a nice pont at which i stand - ohhh noo, it _has_ to be moving, to be doing, to be active, so the damn thing goes off on it's lil runs and journeys and wanders as it will and i get stuck with the results - a whole extra , further burst of ideas, new stuff, more stuff, and worst of all - stuff we don't even know for sure we can do. grrrr.
- guess what though? 12-13hrs later we ended up with al those darned new ideas working the port done, the whole thing competely and uttelry and totally complete, tidied polished, and pushed to it's ultimate end - a fast tiny and memory efficent wonder an absolute lil gem. so i may have skipped the code n the math and the actual entire of the actaul programing - basically everyrhing this damned site is about, but neverthless, there's the story of the mental process that lead to this happenig and hence drove the code n the math n all that gorgous tasty stuff!
