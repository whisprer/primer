# Code of Conduct

## Our Standards

This project is about benchmarking algorithms, not people. We expect:

- **Technical focus** — Discuss code, not contributors
- **Constructive criticism** — "This could be faster because..." not "This is bad"
- **Respectful disagreement** — Multiple valid approaches exist
- **Inclusive language** — Accessible to all skill levels

## LLM Fairness

When comparing LLM-generated code:

- Present results objectively
- Acknowledge that LLM outputs vary by prompt and context
- Avoid anthropomorphizing or disparaging any AI system
- Document the exact prompts used for reproducibility

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Personal attacks or insults
- Discrimination of any kind
- Deliberately misleading benchmarks
- Claiming others' work as your own

## Enforcement

Violations may result in:

1. Comment removal
2. PR rejection
3. Temporary or permanent ban

## Scope

This applies to:

- GitHub issues and pull requests
- Code comments
- Documentation
- Related discussions
